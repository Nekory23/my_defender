# {EPITECH} | First year | C Graphical Programming project

This project is a Tower Defense game. A Good example of this kind of games is Revenge of the titans
Your main challenge for this game will be to create nice and smooth user interface and menus.

Your game must follow the following rules:
  - The player is a builder who must defend his castle,
  - Enemy waves will regularly appear from one side of the playground,
  - The player must buy and place buildings on the playground grid to block/kill enemies,
  - Buildings can be offensive (towers attacking) or defensive (basic walls),
  - When the castle is reached by an enemy, it takes damages,
  - If the castle reaches 0 hit points the player loose.

Having a pleasant user interface is one of the details that makes a good quality game, this project is the
occasion for you to try your best on that topic.

See the subject for further details !
